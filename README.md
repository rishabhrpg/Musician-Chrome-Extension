Control JioSaavn playlist without Navigating to the tab.
JioSaavn Controller for Google Chrome. Control your JioSaavn music player opened in a tab in chrome without actually navigating to the tab itself. 
     
      The main motive behind the development of this extension is to provide the users who use chrome and JioSaavn with a seamless user experience when the need to toggle between the songs of a playlist(in JioSaavn) arises (which is more likely to happen). A Survey says that a typical user opens more than 20 tabs in a single browsing session which makes it difficult to find the tab in which the JioSaavn Music Player is opened every time  when the need to toggle between the song arises. This Extension provides an elegant solution to this problem. Having said that, the user interface of this extension is really simple which enables the users to play\pause or toggle to previous\next track in the selected playlist.There are three self explanatory buttons which are included in the UI to achieve the same. To brief the working of this extension it mainly includes three buttons which are as follows:

                -> Next track 
                -> Play/Pause the current track   
                -> Previous track
                -> Song name and Album name   
                -> Thumbnail of Album 
       
           When more number Of tabs are opened ,it becomes difficult for the user to search for the tab in which the JioSaavn music player is opened and toggle the song, this chrome extension aims in eliminating this problem by providing a UI with which the user can toggle between the songs without actually navigating to the JioSaavn tab itself.

HAPPY LISTENING :)
